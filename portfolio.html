        <h3>Target Testing Bench</h3>
        <button class="toggle-details">Click For Details</button>
        <p class="project-details hidden">
          During my internship at Level Up Live, I designed and developed a target testing bench
          for shooting sports facilities. The project involved mechanical and electrical
          integration, and it was a fantastic learning opportunity.

          <a href="https://washingtonhyperloop.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">
            Washington Hyperloops</a>,
          I worked on a tunnel boring machine project focusing on structural design and automation.
          This was a challenging and rewarding experience that gave me hands-on skills in
          engineering.

        <h3>SET! Card Game</h3>
        <button class="toggle-details">Click For Details</button>
        <p class="project-details hidden">
          As a personal endeavor, I engineered a digital rendition of the SET! card game, harnessing HTML5,
          CSS3, and JavaScript. This application enables real-time player interactions, requiring users to
          identify card sets by attributes such as number, color, shape, and shading. My technical
          contributions included advanced game logic for card selection, set validation, and real-time
          scoring. I implemented a dynamic state management system to enhance gameplay continuity. The
          UI/UX was designed for intuitive interaction, incorporating responsive design for optimal
          device compatibility and engaging animations for a compelling visual experience. This project
          was an exercise in complex algorithmic challenges, ensuring a non-repetitive and immersive
          gaming experience.

        <h3>CSGO Themed Interactive Webpage</h3>
        <button class="toggle-details">Click For Details</button>
        <p class="project-details hidden">
          I developed an interactive website centered around Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO),
          leveraging multiple public APIs to display data on guns, magazines, and batches. The project integrates
          the Fetch API for asynchronous data retrieval, handling JSON responses to dynamically update the UI.
          Specific APIs used include the CSGO API for game-related data and the Free Dictionary API for terminologies.
          Advanced JavaScript features were employed to implement interactive elements such as clickable icons
          that play sound effects, enhancing the user interaction. Care was taken to optimize API requests,
          implementing caching strategies to reduce load times and avoid exceeding request quotas. The page layout
          was designed using modern CSS techniques, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience across
          different devices. Error handling was meticulously implemented to provide informative feedback,
          ensuring a robust user experience even when API responses fail or are delayed.
